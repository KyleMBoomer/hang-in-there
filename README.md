### Abstract:
This application allows the user to be able to create random posters from the click of a button. The user is also able to create their own custom posters if they'd like by adding their own image URLs, titles, and quotes. The user can also save any of the random created posters or their custom posters. The application is solving the problem of not having the same boring posters.

### Context:
It took us about 8 hours to complete the entire application. We are both Mod1 repeaters so completing this came a little bit more naturally for us after having a similar project beforehand.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to understand and implement event listeners, query selectors, and to be able to access and manipulate the DOM.  


### Wins
1. We learned what and how to use the ParseInt method!
2. When we got stuck one of our mentors helped fix an issue after we reached out for help. 
3. We better understood our code in this project and is cleaner this time as well. 

#### Challenges
1. We got stuck on removing elements from our data model when we had success removing them from the DOM. We researched the parseInt method and altered what we had to work with it.
2. We got stuck with properly displaying the correct interpolated properties of objects produced by our event listeners. We reached out to a mentor and found out that what we originally had wasn't defined and that we were inputing the wrong elements from the DOM.
